# udacity-project3-portfolio

# Introduction
This is project 3 for the Udacity web developer nanodegree.

The goal of this project is to use HTML and CSS to create a responsive portfolio that will work in desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The projects themselves are just for show and do not represent real code.

Note: that the color guides were not to be used in the portfolio, but it wasn't specified, and I decided to leave them in since it makes an interesting change for mobile mode.

# Instructions

Either copy or clone the files to your local directory. Open the portfoliod by clicking on index.html.

Resize the display to test mobile, tablet, desktop, and large desktop screens.
